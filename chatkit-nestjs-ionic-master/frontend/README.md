# Building a mobile app with Nest.js, Ionic 4 and Chatkit - Part 2: Build the frontend

In the previous [tutorial]() we have created the server side of our chat application that uses TypeScript, Nest.js and Chatkit. Now, in this tutorial, we are going to create the front-end mobile application using Ionic and Chatkit.  

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial you need to have these prerequisites:

- Working knowledge of TypeScript,
- Working knowledge of Angular (we'll be using Ionic with Angular),
- Recent versions of Node.js and npm installed on your system.



Next clone the repository using

```
git clone https://github.com/techiediaries/chatkit-nestjs-ionic.git

```

Finally navigate inside the project's folder and install the dependenices:

```bash
cd cd chatkit-nestjs-ionic/frontend
npm install
```

Next start the development server using:

```bash
ionic serve
```

You can then access your app from `localhost:8000` in your browser.
