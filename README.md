# Chatkit Ionic & Nest.js Demo application

This project contains the code for the frontend and server parts of a chat application built with Pusher's Chatkit.

The frontend project is built using the latest Ionic 4 version.

The server project is built using Nest.js.


These are the instructions for how you can run both apps. 

First clone the project: 


    $ git clone https://github.com/techiediaries/chatkit-nestjs-ionic.git

Next, navigate inside the project's frontend folder and install the dependencies:


    $ cd chatkit-nestjs-ionic/frontend
    $ npm install
